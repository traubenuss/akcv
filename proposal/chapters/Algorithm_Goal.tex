\section{Goal}

The goal of the algorithm presented by Singh et. al in their paper "Unsupervised Discovery of Mid-Level Discriminative Patches" 
is to find a set of \textit{discriminative patches} which can serve as a mid-level visual representation of an image.

In order for this to be possible, a patch needs to fulfil the following  requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item to be \emph{representative}. The patch needs to occur frequently enough in the visual world. 
\item to be \emph{discriminative}. The patch needs to be sufficiently different from the from the rest of the visual world. 
\end{itemize}

The idea of this approach is that images can be visually described by such frequently occurring and discriminative patches. 
The authors method is also unsupervised, which means that no labelling of the training data is necessary.

The goal of this project is to re-implement this algorithm and evaluate the results.

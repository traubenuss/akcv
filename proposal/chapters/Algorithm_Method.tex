\section{Method of the Algorithm}

In this section a short overview of the algorithm itself is given.
The detection of discriminative patches is done by iterative clustering and learning SVM classifiers in HOG space. As in all iterative algorithms, there is an initializing part and a repeating process. The most important steps of these are described below.\\

Initializing steps
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate HOG descriptors on all input images of a given input image set $\mathcal{D}$ in multiple scales (HOG with 8x8 cells and a stride of 8 pixels/cell)
\item Calculate the same descriptors on an image set called $\mathcal{N}$, which represents the "whole visual world" and should be much larger than $\mathcal{D}$
\item Split set $\mathcal{D}$ in equal parts (called $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$) and $\mathcal{N}$ in $\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{N}_2$ for cross validation
\item Randomly sample $\mathcal{S}$ patches of $\mathcal{D}_1$ (excluding patches with high overlap and low gradient energy)
\item perform k-means clustering with $k \approx \lvert\mathcal{S}\rvert/4$
\item remove clusters with less than 3 patches
\end{itemize}

Iterative part
\begin{itemize}
\item Train linear SVM classifiers using the patches of each cluster as positive set and all patches of $\mathcal{N}_1$ as negative set.
(If $\mathcal{D}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{N}$, exclude patches from $\mathcal{N}$ where normalized cross-correlation $> 0.4$)
\item Run the trained SVM's on all patches of $\mathcal{D}_2$
\item Determine new clusters by the top 5 most firing patches of each learned SVM (SVM score above $-1$ is considered as firing)
\item Remove clusters which consist of less than 2 patches
\item Switch the role of $\mathcal{D}_1$, $\mathcal{N}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$, $\mathcal{N}_2$ (when again training the SVM's, clusters now consist of patches from the other subset of $\mathcal{D}$)
\end{itemize}

As an abortion criteria non existent changing of the top 5 patches each cluster can be considered.

\section{Implementation}

To implement the algorithm as described above in MATLAB, many build-in functionalities can be used.
The k-means algorithm as well as SVM training and classifier methods are provided by default.\\
To calculate the HOG descriptors, additional to the standard MATLAB commands the VLFeat package will be included.\\

To handle the enormous amount of data, the idea is to store only the HOG features of the images at different scales in the memory. A patch is then defined by an own data structure which only contains the position, the size and a reference to the origin image. Hence each required HOG descriptor of a patch can be extracted from the HOG descriptor of the origin image on demand.\\

To get a natural world set $\mathcal{N}$ which is supposed contain the "whole visual world", we stick to the idea of the paper\footnote{'Unsupervised Discovery of Mid-level Discriminative Patches' from S. Singh et. al.} and sample about 6000 random images from flickr.com.\\

Unfortunately on the website\footnote{http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/discriminativePatches/} of the paper, there is yet no source code online for comparison.

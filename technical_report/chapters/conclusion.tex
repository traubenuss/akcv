\section{Conclusion}

As a conclusion we might say that while the method yields promising results in the paper it was introduced in 
(see \cite{Singh2012DiscPat}), it needs a lot of computational resources which might render the method unpractical.\\
\\
It was impossible for us to reproduce the results shown in the publication by Singh et al., but our evaluation results
might work as a proof of concept and could be improved by running the code on a cluster of computers with a much bigger
world set $\mathcal{N}$ and bigger discovery set $\mathcal{D}$.

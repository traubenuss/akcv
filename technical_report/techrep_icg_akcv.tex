% The template contains a number of LaTeX commands of the form :

% \command{xyz}

%

% In order to complete this abstract, fill in the blank fields between

% the curly braces or replace already filled in fields with the

% requested information.

%

% e.g. in order to add an abstract title, replace

% \title{}    with   \title{Evidence of Solitons in Tedium Diboride}

%

% The \author and \address commands can take an optional label

% in square brackets of the form :

%

% \command[label]{}

%

% The text of the abstract should be inserted between the two commands

% \begin{abstract} and \end{abstract}.

%

% Please leave all commands in place even if you don't fill them in.

\begin{abstract}



This technical report is the result of the KU AKCV 2012/2013. Our task was to investigate
and evaluate the results and performance of a method presented in ~\cite{Singh2012DiscPat}.
This paper by Singh et al. presents a method for unsupervised discovery of \textit{discriminative patches}
which can serve as a mid-level visual representation. 
The discovered patches need to fullfil the following two requirements:
\begin{itemize}
 \item they need to be \textit{representative}, which means that they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world.
 \item they need to be \textit{discriminative}, which means that they need to differ enough from the rest of the visual world.
\end{itemize}

As stated before, these patches which represent the image should be found in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, Singh et al.
pose the problem of finding these patches as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches.
